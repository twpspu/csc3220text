            <p>The property we’re concerned with here, <strong>usability</strong>, is more precise than just how “good”
              the system is. A system can be good or bad in many ways.</p>

            <p>If important requirements are unsatisfied by the system, that’s probably a deficiency in functionality,
              not in usability.</p>

            <p>If the system is very expensive or crashes frequently, those problems certainly detract from the user’s
              experience, but we don’t need user testing to tell us that.</p>

            <p>More narrowly defined, usability measures how well users can use the system’s functionality. Usability
              has several dimensions: learnability, efficiency, and safety.</p>

            <p>These aren’t the only aspects of a user interface that you might care about (for example, subjective
              feelings are important too, as is fatigue), but these are the primary ones we’ll care about in this class.
            </p>

            <p>Notice that we can <strong>quantify</strong> all these measures of usability. Just as we can say
              algorithm X is faster than algorithm Y on some workload, we can say that interface X is more learnable, or
              more efficient, or more safe than interface Y for some set of tasks and some class of users, by designing
              an experiment that measures the two interfaces.</p>

                      <p>Missile launchers need safety</p>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The usability dimensions are not uniformly important for all classes of users, or for all applications.
              That’s one reason why it’s important to understand your users, so that you know what you should optimize
              for. A web site used only once by millions of people–e.g., the national telephone do-not-call registry–has
              such a strong need for ease of learning, in fact zero learning, that it far outweighs other concerns. A
              stock trading program used on a daily basis by expert traders, for whom lost seconds translate to lost
              dollars, must put efficiency above all else.</p>

            <p>But users can’t be simply classified as novices or experts, either. For some applications (like stock
              trading), your users may be domain experts, deeply knowledgeable about the stock market, and yet still be
              novices at your particular application. Even users with long experience using an application may be
              novices or infrequent users when it comes to some of its features.</p>

            <p>Usability doesn’t exist in isolation, of course, and it may not even be the most important property of
              some systems. Astronauts may care more about reliability of their navigation computer than its usability;
              military systems would rather be secure than easy to log into. Ideally these should be false dichotomies:
              we’d rather have systems that are reliable, secure, and usable. But in the real world, development
              resources are finite, and tradeoffs must be made.</p>

<p>In this class, we’ll take an extreme position: usability will be our primary goal. Here’s a familiar UI design. You’ve probably used it before, but probably without thinking much about its usability. We’re handing some out for you to play with and think about.</p></div></div>

                <li>
                  <p>The user is ALWAYS right</p>

                      <p>Usability problems are the design’s fault</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Unfortunately, user interfaces are not easy to design. You (the developer) are not a typical user. You
              know far more about your application than any user will. You can try to imagine being your mother, or
              your grandma, but it doesn’t help much. It’s very hard to forget things you know.</p>

            <p>This is how usability is different from everything else you learn about software engineering.
              Specifications, assertions, and object models are all about communicating with other programmers, who
              are probably a lot like us. Usability is about communicating with other users, who are probably not like
              us.</p>

            <p>The user is always right. Don’t blame the user for what goes wrong. If users consistently make mistakes
              with some part of your interface, take it as a sign that your interface is wrong, not that the users are
              dumb. This lesson can be very hard for a software designer to swallow!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the user is not always right. Users aren’t oracles. They don’t always know what they
              want, or what would help them. In a study conducted in the 1950s, people were asked whether they would
              prefer lighter telephone handsets, and on average, they said they were happy with the handsets they had
              (which at the time were made rather heavy for durability). Yet an actual test of telephone handsets,
              identical except for weight, revealed that people preferred the handsets that were about half the weight
              that was normal at the time. (Klemmer, Ergonomics, Ablex, 1989, pp 197-201).</p>

            <p>Another example: Google has discovered that when they survey users about how many search results they
              want per page (10, 20, 30), users overwhelmingly say “30 results”. But when Google actually deploys
              30-result search pages (as part of an “A/B test”, which we’ll talk about in a later reading), usage
              drops by 20% relative to the conventional 10-result page. Why? Probably because the 30-result page takes
              a half second longer to load (<a
                href="http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2009/10/31/TheCostOfLatency.aspx">The Cost of Latency</a>).</p>

            <p>Users aren’t designers, either, and shouldn’t be forced to fill that role.</p>

            <p>It’s easy to say, “Yeah, the interface is bad, but users can customize it however they want it.” There
              are two problems with this statement: (1) most users don’t, and (2) user customizations may be even
              worse! One study of command abbreviations found that users made twice as many errors with their own
              command abbreviations than with a carefully-designed set (Grudin &amp; Barnard, “When does an
              abbreviation become a word?”, CHI ‘85). So customization isn’t the silver bullet.</p>

            <p>This dialog box, which appeared in a program that prints custom award certificates, presents the task of
              selecting a template for the certificate.
              This interface is clearly graphical. It’s mouse-driven–no memorizing or typing complicated commands. It’s
              even what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG)–the user gets a preview of the award that will be created.</p>

            <p>So why isn’t it usable?</p>

            <p>The first clue that there might be a problem here is the long help message on the left side. Why so much
              help for a simple selection task? Because the interface is bizarre! The scrollbar is used to select an
              award template.</p>

            <p>Each position on the scrollbar represents a template, and moving the scrollbar back and forth changes the
              template shown.</p>

            <p>This is a cute but poor use of a scrollbar. Notice that the scrollbar doesn’t have any marks on it. How
              many templates are there? How are they sorted? How far do you have to move the scrollbar to select the
              next one? You can’t even guess from this interface.</p>

              <p class="caption"></p>

              <p></p>
            </div>

            <p>Normally, a horizontal scrollbar underneath an image (or document, or some other content) is designed for
              scrolling the content horizontally. A new or infrequent user looking at the window sees the scrollbar,
              assumes it serves that function, and ignores it. Inconsistency with prior experience and other
              applications tends to trip up new or infrequent users.</p>

            <p>Another way to put it is that the horizontal scrollbar is an affordance for continuous scrolling, not for
              discrete selection. We see affordances out in the real world, too; a door knob says “turn me”, a handle
              says “pull me”.</p>

            <p>We’ve all seen those apparently-pullable door handles with a little sign that says “Push”; and many of us
              have had the embarrassing experience of trying to pull on the door before we notice the sign. The help
              text on this dialog box is filling the same role here.</p>

            <p>But the dialog doesn’t get any better for frequent users, either. If a frequent user wants a template
              they’ve used before, how can they find it? Surely they’ll remember that it’s 56% of the way along the
              scrollbar? This interface provides no shortcuts for frequent users. In fact, this interface takes what
              should be a random access process and transforms it into a linear process. Every user has to look through
              all the choices, even if they already know which one they want. The computer scientist in you should
              cringe at that algorithm.</p>

            <p>Even the help text has usability problems. “Press OKAY”? Where is that? And why does the message have a
              ragged left margin? You don’t see ragged left too often in newspapers and magazine layout, and there’s a
              good reason.</p>

            <p>On the plus side, the designer of this dialog box at least recognized that there was a problem–hence the
              help message. But the help message is indicative of a flawed approach to usability.</p>

            <p>Usability can’t be left until the end of software development, like package artwork or an installer. It
              can’t be patched here and there with extra messages or more documentation. It must be part of the process,
              so that usability bugs can be fixed, instead of merely patched.</p>

            <p>How could this dialog box be redesigned to solve some of these problems?</p>

            </div>

            <p>Here’s one way it might be redesigned. The templates now fill a list box on the left; selecting a
              template shows its preview on the right. This interface suffers from none of the problems of its
              predecessor: list boxes clearly afford selection to new or infrequent users; random access is trivial for
              frequent users. And no help message is needed.</p>

              <p></p>
            </div>

            <p>Here’s another bizarre interface, taken from a program that launches housekeeping tasks at scheduled
              intervals.</p>

            <p>The date and time look like editable fields (affordance), but you can’t edit them with the keyboard.
              Instead, if you want to change the time, you have to click on the Set Time button to bring up a dialog
              box.</p>

            <p>This dialog box displays time differently, using 12-hour time (7:17 pm) where the original dialog used
              24-hour time (consistency). Just to increase the confusion, it also adds a third representation, an analog
              clock face.</p>

            <p>So how is the time actually changed? By clicking mouse buttons: clicking the left mouse button increases
              the minute by 1 (wrapping around from 59 to 0), and clicking the right mouse button increases the hour.
              Sound familiar? This designer has managed to turn a sophisticated graphical user interface, full of
              windows, buttons, and widgets, and controlled by a hundred-key keyboard and two-button mouse, into a
              <em>clock radio</em>!</p>

            <p>Perhaps the worst part of this example is that it’s not a result of laziness. Somebody went to a lot of
              effort to draw that clock face with hands. If only they’d spent some of that time thinking about usability
              instead.</p>

            <p>Gimp is an open-source image editing program, comparable to Adobe Photoshop. Gimp’s designers made a
              strange choice for its menus. Gimp windows have no menu bar. Instead, all Gimp menus are accessed from a
              <strong>context menu</strong>, which pops up on right-click.</p>

            <p>This is certainly inconsistent with other applications, and new users are likely to stumble trying to
              find, for example, the File menu, which never appears on a context menu in other applications. (I
              certainly stumbled as a new user of Gimp.) But Gimp’s designers were probably thinking about expert users
              when they made this decision. A context menu should be faster to invoke, since you don’t have to move the
              mouse up to the menu bar. A context menu can be popped up anywhere. So it should be faster. Right?</p>

            <p>Wrong. With Gimp’s design, as soon as the mouse hovers over a choice on the context menu (like File or
              Edit), the submenu immediately pops up to the right. That means, if I want to reach an option on the File
              menu, I have to move my mouse carefully to the right, staying within the File choice, until it reaches the
              File submenu. If my mouse ever strays into the Edit item, the File menu I’m aiming for vanishes, replaced
              by the Edit menu. So if I want to select File/Quit, I can’t just drag my mouse in a straight line from
              File to Quit–I have to drive into the File menu, turn 90 degrees and then drive down to Quit! Hierarchical
              submenus are actually slower to use than a menu bar.</p>

            <p>Part of the problem here is the way GTK (the UI toolkit used by Gimp) implements submenus. Changing the
              submenu immediately is probably a bad idea. Microsoft Windows does it a little better–you have to hover
              over a choice for about half a second before the submenu appears, so if you veer off course briefly, you
              won’t lose your target. But you still have to make that right-angle turn.</p>

            <p>Apple Macintosh does even better: when a submenu opens, there’s a triangular zone, spreading from the
              mouse to the submenu, in which the mouse pointer can move without losing the submenu. So you can drive
              diagonally toward Quit without losing the File menu, or you can drive straight down to get to the Edit
              menu instead.
              Gimp’s designers made a choice without fully considering how it interacted with human capabilities. We’ll
              see that there are some techniques and principles that we can use to predict how decisions like this will
              affect a user interface–and we’ll also see how we can measure and evaluate the actual effects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="slide col-sm-6">

              <img src="figures/06a.png">
            </div>

            <p>There’s another interesting design feature in Gimp’s menus–well-intentioned and clever, but problematic
              in practice. Suppose my mouse is halfway down the File menu when I notice that the Quit command actually
              has a keyboard shortcut: Ctrl-Q. Great! So I press it.</p>

            <p>But it doesn’t invoke the Quit command. Instead, it changes the shortcut of whatever command my mouse is
              hovering over–in this case, Save–to Ctrl-Q. This is a <strong>mode</strong>: a state of the system in
              which a user action has a different meaning than it does in other states. Modes may be inevitable in user
              interfaces, but <strong>mode errors</strong>–using the action in the wrong mode, so it does something you
              don’t intend–do not have to be inevitable.</p>

            <p>Worse, it’s not an easy error to undo. (Pressing Ctrl-Z, the conventional undo shortcut, only makes it
              worse!) I have to reassign the old shortcut to the Save command–if I can remember the original shortcut.
              Then I have find the command whose original shortcut was Ctrl-Q, and restore that one as well. This error
              wasn’t easily <strong>recoverable</strong>.</p>

            <p>Gimp’s designers had a terrific idea here–making it easy to assign keyboard shortcuts by just pointing at
              the menu item you want to change and pressing the shortcut. That’s simple and elegant, in fact far simpler
              than most customization interfaces. But they’ve given us too much rope, and it’s easy to hang ourselves.
              This interface isn’t <strong>safe</strong> to use.</p>

            <p>In Emacs, Ctrl-S starts an <strong>incremental search</strong>. This is a well-designed feature.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>it’s highly <strong>responsive</strong>: updates as fast as the user can type</li>
              <li>it’s easily and obviously <strong>reversible</strong>: press Backspace if you made a mistake</li>
              <li>it provides immediate <strong>feedback</strong> about what it’s doing</li>
              <li>successful searches may even achieve early success: only 3 letters was enough to find
                BasicProgressGenerator, and I could instantly tell that it was enough</li>
              <li>user gets early feedback about typos and failed searches</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What’s the downside? All its controls are <strong>invisible</strong>. How do you start the incremental
              search? How do you search again? How do you go backwards? How do you do a case-sensitive search?</p>

            <p>Once learned, however, these commands are simple. Ctrl-S starts the search. Pressing Ctrl-S again looks
              for a later match. (But now there is the possibility of mode error!) Pressing Ctrl-R looks backwards for a
              previous match. (What does Backspace do?) Using any capitalized letters in your query forces a
              case-sensitive search. (But how do I search for an all-lowercase string case-sensitively?)</p>

            <p>XEmacs has menus (the original Emacs didn’t). Alas, XEmacs isn’t interested in helping users learn
              incremental search. Instead, it pops up this conventional Find dialog, which scores great on visibility,
              but lacks the responsiveness, easy reversibility, and fast performance of incremental search. Even worse,
              it covers up the matches you’re trying to find unless you manhandle it out of the way!</p>

            <p>Finally, we have the much-reviled Microsoft Office Paperclip.</p>

            <p>Clippy was a well-intentioned effort to solve a real usability problem. Users don’t read the manual,
              don’t use the online help, and don’t know how to find the answers to their problems. Clippy tries to
              suggest answers to the problem it thinks you’re having.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately it’s often wrong, often intrusive, and often annoying.</p>

            <p>The subjective quality of your interface matters too.</p>
